My goal is to first connect via WiFi, then Ping the router to obtain CSI data, and finally send the data to the computer through UDP. However, there is not enough running space in the whole process. I wonder if there is any optimization method.

# How to use example
asi_ udp.py file is used by the server to receive data from esp32
